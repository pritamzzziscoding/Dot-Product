## Definations
<ins>**General Defination :**</ins> In mathematics, the __*dot product*__ or __*scalar product*__ is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number.

>It is often called the inner product.

<ins>**Algebric Defination:**</ins> Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers.

## Mathematical Formula
Let two vectors be **a** and **b** then Their Dot Product is :

$$\text{\textbf{a}.\textbf{b}}= \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i  b_i = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2+ \ldots a_nb_n$$

## Geometrical Meaning
In Euclidean space, a Euclidean vector is a geometric object that possesses both a magnitude and a direction. A vector can be pictured as an arrow. Its magnitude is its length, and its direction is the direction to which the arrow points.

The magnitude of a vector **a** is given by $||a|| = \sqrt{a_1^{2} + a_2^{2} + \ldots a_n^{2}}$ which is also known as Euclidean Norm
